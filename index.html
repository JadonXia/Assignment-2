      <p><u>Introduction</u></p>
      <p>Sir Timothy Berners-Lee, or TimBL, is one of the most influential people in the history of computer science. Accredited as the inventor of the <b>World Wide Web</b>, Berners-Lee is also the founder of the <b>World Wide Web Foundation</b> (<b>WWWF</b>), the director of the <b>World Wide Web Consortium</b> (<b>W3C</b>), and founding director of the <b>Web Science Research Initiative</b> (<b>WSRI</b>, now <b>Web Science Trust</b>, <b>WST</b>). He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004 for his pioneering work.</p>

      <p><u>Berners-Lee's Early Life</u></p>
      <p>Berners-Lee was born on June 8<sup>th</sup>, 1955 in London England. His parents, Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee, were both computer scientists who worked on the first commerially available computer, the Ferranti Mark 1. As a child, Berners-Lee was very interested in rail transport, learning about electronics from tinkering with a model railway. He studied at The Queen's College at Oxford University from 1973-1976, graduating with a first-class BA degree in physics.</p>
      <p>Berners-Lee designed software for around two years at Plessey Telecommunications Ltd. before working at the <b>European Organization for Nuclear Research in 1980</b> (<i>Conseil européen pour la recherche nucléaire</i>, <b>CERN</b>). There, he developed his own computer program, called Enquire. It stored information in files that contained connections, or links, within and among separate files. This program later became known as <b>hypertext</b>. Berners-Lee left CERN in 1980 to work for Image Computer Systems Ltd.</p>
      <br>
      <p><u>The World Wide Web</u></p>
      <p>In 1984, Berners-Lee returned to CERN with extensive experience in computer networking. He worked on the design of the laboratory's computer network, where he developed procedures that allowed different computers to communicate with each other. In 1989, Berners-Lee drew up a proposal for creating a global hypertext document system that would make use of the <b>Internet</b>. He wrote the software for the first Web server and browser from 1990-1991, stating:</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">
        I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the Transmission Control Protocol and domain name system ideas and—ta-da!—the World Wide Web.
      </blockquote>
      <p>Initially used to facilitate communication between researchers, Berners-Lee's Web was later ranked number once in a list of 80 cultural moments that shaped the world, chosen by a panel of 25 eminent scientists, academics, writers, and world leaders. The entry described it as <q>The fastest growing communications medium of all time, the Internet has changed the shape of modern life forever. We can connect with each other instantly, all over the world.</q> Berners-Lee founded the <b>W3C</b> in 1994, which gave oversight to the Web and developed certain standards for it. He became a founding director of the <b>WST</b> in 2006, created with the aim of supporting the development of Web science. In 2009, Berners-Lee launched the <b>WWWF</b>, with the campaign to <q>advance the Web to empower humanity by launching transformative programs that build local capacity to leverage the Web as a medium for positive change.</q></p>
      <br>
      <p><u>21<sup>st</sup> century</u></p>
      <p>Berners-Lee is an active advocate for net neutrality, the ideology that <b>Internet service providers</b> (<b>ISPs</b>) must treat all Internet communications equally, and not discriminate or change differently based on user, content, website, platform, application, type of equipment, source address, destination address, or method of communication. He received numerous honours and awards in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, including knighting by Queen Elizabeth II (2004), appointment to the Order of Merit (2007), the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering (2013), and the ACM Turing Award <q>for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale</q>. Undoubtedly, the world would have been a much more different place without Tim Berners-Lee and his wonderful invention.</p>
